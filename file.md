1. Change every NextGen Cyber Talent to Global Cyber Talent Initiative (GCTI)
2. About the Programme

NextGen Cyber Talent is a 12‑month, industry‑aligned development programme designed to prepare early‑career professionals for real cybersecurity roles—not just exams.

Built with employers in mind, the programme combines structured learning, continuous assessment, and practical delivery so organisations can engage talent with confidence.

Participants progress through a clearly defined curriculum that mirrors workplace realities: hands‑on labs, supervised projects, collaborative problem‑solving, and professional standards expected in live environments. Learning is active, measurable, and outcome‑driven.

Unlike short courses or purely theoretical training, learners are continuously assessed across technical capability, reliability, communication, and security mindset. Progress is tracked, evidenced, and benchmarked throughout the programme.

Performance‑Based Talent Framework

To make engagement simple and transparent, learners are ranked within a structured performance framework. These tiers reflect demonstrated capability and readiness—not potential promises.

Platinum (Cyber Teal)
Consistently high performers. Strong technical execution, dependable delivery, and clear professional judgement. Ready for complex responsibilities.

Gold (Cyber Teal with Electric Blue accent)
Highly capable and reliable. Performs strongly across most domains with minimal supervision.

Silver (Muted Electric Blue)
Solid foundational capability. Demonstrates growing confidence and benefits from guided exposure.

Bronze (Soft Neutral Grey‑Blue)
Early‑stage learners. Actively developing core skills within a structured, supervised environment.

This framework allows employers to engage talent at the level that matches their risk appetite, capacity, and business needs—without guesswork.

What Employers Can Expect

* A clearly structured 12‑month programme with defined milestones
* Practical, work‑relevant skills developed through real scenarios
* Ongoing assessment rather than one‑off certification
* Transparent performance differentiation
* Talent that understands professional standards, not just tools
